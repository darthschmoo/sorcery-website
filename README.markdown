## Sorcery website

This is a very early release of a Rails 3.1 site, somewhat targeted towards authors who want to publish on the web.  It's mostly a personal project, but if it works for somebody, that's cool.

Powers http://bannedsorcery.com.

### Features ###

* A primitive CMS (based on Markdown markup language, via Bluecloth).
* A primitive permissions system (no users.  If you're logged in, you can do anything.)
* Probably other stuff someday.

### Installation ###

Should be no different from most Rails apps.  Message me if you need help.  Send a pull request if you want to contribute bugfixes or features.


[GitHub tip:  If you call your README file README.markdown, it will be interpreted by GitHub as markdown, rather than... not sure what the default is.]
