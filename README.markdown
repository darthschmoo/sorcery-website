## Sorcery website

This is a very early release of a Rails 3.1 site, somewhat targeted towards authors who want to publish on the web.  It's mostly a personal project, but if it works for somebody, that's cool.

### Features ###

* A primitive CMS (based on Markdown markup language, via Bluecloth).
* A primitive permissions system (no users.  If you're logged in, you can do anything.)
* Probably other stuff someday.
