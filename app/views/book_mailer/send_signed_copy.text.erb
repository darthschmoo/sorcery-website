Instructions for loading onto your e-reader:

Nook:  Plug the Nook into your computer and copy the .epub file to its "My Documents" folder.
                                                     
Kindle: Plug in the Kindle, copy the .mobi file to the "Documents" folder.  More help can be
found at http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200375630 .

Kindle Fire:  Same process as Kindle, but I believe the .mobi file goes into the "Books" folder.

You can also use Calibre (a free, open source program) to manage the books on your device, and to
read ebooks on your laptop.  Visit calibre-ebook.com for details.

For other devices... really, I have no advice beyond "consult Google the All-Seer."
