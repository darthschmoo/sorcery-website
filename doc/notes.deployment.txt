Deployment

1) install rvm on tux
   a) install curl via apt-get
   b) bash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer )  # from http://beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/
   c) add /home/andersbr/.rvm/bin/rvm to path
   d) rvm install 1.9.2
   e) rvm use 1.9.2
   
2) Get tux upgraded to passenger
   a) gem install passenger
   b) [failed to install apache module, so]  sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
   c) [retrying]  passenger-install-apache2-module
   d) edit passenger.load (example):
      LoadModule passenger_module /home/andersbr/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p290/gems/passenger-3.0.9/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so
   
   e) edit passenger.conf (example):
      PassengerRoot /home/andersbr/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p290/gems/passenger-3.0.9
      PassengerRuby /home/andersbr/.rvm/wrappers/ruby-1.9.2-p290/ruby
   
   f) enable site (deployed to /var/www/sorcery/current:
   
      <VirtualHost 204.8.230.52:80>
         ServerName www.bannedsorcery.com
         DocumentRoot /var/www/sorcery/current/public    # <-- be sure to point to 'public'!
         <Directory /var/www/sorcery/current/public>
            AllowOverride all              # <-- relax Apache security settings
            Options -MultiViews            # <-- MultiViews must be turned off
         </Directory>
      </VirtualHost>
      
    g) created /var/www/sorcery/current/public/index.html.  Still getting gedview site when I request bannedsorcery.com or www.bannedsorcery.com
    h) Changed VirtualHost *:80 to specific ip 204.8...   Works now.
    
3) Make app cap-deployable
   a) capify .  (creates Capfile and deploy recipe template)
   b) push code out to GitHub
   c) configure deploy recipe
   d) make sure target /var/www/sorcery is bryce-writable.
   e) cap deploy:setup  (which failed)
   f) set use_sudo to false.  Works now.
   g) cap deploy  (which failed)
   h) added forwarded agent to ssh options
   i) cap deploy worked
   j) cap deploy:migrate  
        failed:  no such file to load: bundler/setup
        switched default ruby for my account to 1.9.2 (rvm use 1.9.2 --default)
        still failed:  no such file to load -- bundler/setup
        manually ran bundle/install in the release directory
          gems installed
        still failed
          rake doesn't seem to be working. "Could not find javascript runtime."  WTF?
          Ignoring that.
          
        mysql socket is in a different location.  Changing and resubmitting.
        Getting closer
        rake db:create RAILS_ENV=production   (manual)
        rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production  (manual)
        
        Error:  Could not find archive-tar-minitar-0.5.2 in any of the sources
          re-running bundle install  (which did install archive-tar-minitar)
        Worked!
        
    k) Calling up bannedsorcery.com
       Still getting error, related to my own stupidity.  Not documented to decrease shame.
