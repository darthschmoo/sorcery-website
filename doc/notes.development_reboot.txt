2015-04-03: Restarting development on bannedsorcery Rails code
==============================================================

Goals
-----

1. Eliminate all code related to translating stories into other file formats?
    * Pros:
        * simplifies code substantially.
        * most of the functionality duplicates epubforge (and badly)
        * simple workaround for all that functionality loss?  just make an 
          up-to-date ebook available with your stories.
        * so much of it only kinda worked anyhow.
    * Cons:
        * if the site goes multiplayer, it would be nice to have.
2. Upgrade to latest Rails and Ruby 2.2
    * Might require getting all my libraries into shape for Ruby 2.x.  Which is a good thing to do anyhow.
3. Get "mail out ebooks" working correctly.  If I'm reading this right, 
   my gmail password has changed and I'm using 2FactorAuth, so it probably 
   doesn't work anymore.
    * https://developers.google.com/gmail/oauth_overview
4. Expand and prettify test suite.  Get shoulda tests working.
